# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict passenger survival outcomes from the infamous 1912 disaster using machine learning. Our goal is to identify key survival determinants by analyzing a dataset that includes age, gender, class, and fare, among other variables³. Let's break down the essential steps involved in this project:

1. Data Exploration and Analysis:
   - Import necessary libraries (NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib).
   - Read the training and test data from CSV files.
   - Explore the data by examining its structure, summary statistics, and distributions.
   - Identify insights such as the average age of survivors, fare rates, and the impact of having parents or siblings¹.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
   - Normalize numeric features if needed.
   - Handle missing values and categorical variables.

3. Model Building:
   - Utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression) to build predictive models.
   - Train the models on the training data.
   - Evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

4. Deployment and Interpretation:
   - Deploy the chosen model to make predictions on new data.
   - Interpret the model results to understand the impact of different features on survival likelihood.
